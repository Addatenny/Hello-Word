# Hello-Word
First Adventure in Github

Hola,

Como estas? I am really interested in the PennApps, so someone suggested I should join GitHub. To me benefits, as of now GitHub is amazing even though I haven't fully understand how it works.
Little bit about myself: I am a 17 year old guy about to be a freshman at Purdue University. I am not an American, I am born and raised in Nigeria for 14 years before moving to America in October 2012. So far, America  is great. I am loving everything in it - but not much of the culture even though it is amazing to learn. Oh! The foods here are supper great and good!
